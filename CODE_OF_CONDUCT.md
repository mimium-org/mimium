## Purpose

As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, nationality, language, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof).

## The mimium community strives to be:

- Prioritize Diversity. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
- Considerate: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. 
- Respect other communities. mimium has been made under the influence of many preceding languages, projects, and music/sound artworks. mimium is not made for surpassing or making them obsolete.
